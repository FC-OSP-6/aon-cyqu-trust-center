/* ================================
  TL;DR  -->  A card that shows control information in each row with a status on right side off the card
      1. There should be cards for the following:
        - Infrastructure Security
        - Organizational Security
        - Product Security
        - Internal Security Procedures
        - Data and Privacy
      2. Within each card should be the control information which consists of:
        - bold h1 text showing the control
        - regular h2 text going into more detail about that control
        - on the right side - the status should include a green check circle
